# EC2-Web-Server-Lab
Practice lab where I built and secured a web server on AWS EC2 — Elastic IP, hardened security groups, and Apache/Nginx manually installed.
# ⚡ Secure EC2 Web Server Lab

## 📝 Description
Hands-on AWS lab showcasing how to securely deploy a public-facing EC2 web server with hardened security groups, Elastic IP management, and manual installation of Apache or Nginx.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Launch a `t3.micro` EC2 instance in a public subnet.
- Attach an Elastic IP for persistent public access.
- Harden Security Group rules:
  - SSH (port 22) allowed from **my IP only**.
  - HTTP (port 80) allowed from **anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)**.
- Manually install and configure Apache or Nginx on Linux.
- Verify public web access.
